// Controlled Form Fields
import React from 'react'

// Here, we want to be able to update the state of the form fields based on
// changes to other fields. This uses a pattern called "controlled props" which
// is supported by all form fields in React.
//
// To control the value of (most) form fields, you simply pass a `value` prop to
// the element and it becomes controlled. From there on, React will cease to
// attempt to update the value itself as the user attempts to make changes to
// it. Instead, you are responsible for making sure that it's kept up to date.
//
// You can do this with the `onChange` prop. Whenever the user makes a change to
// the field value, react will call your change handler and you can use
// `event.target` to know what the new value should be.

// We're going to use React.useReducer.

// This is a utility that you can use in your reducer. It accepts an array of
// values and returns the state that should exist based on that array.
// So the job of your reducer is to take the value from the input that
// experienced the change and turn its values into an array.
// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
function getStateFromArray(array) {
  return {
    commaSeparated: array.join(','),
    multiline: array.join('\n'),
    multiSelect: array.filter(v => availableOptions.includes(v)),
  }
}

// here's the start to your reducer
// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
function fancyFormReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'COMMA_SEPARATED': {
      // 🐨 change this to handle the `action.value` from the comma-separated
      // input.
      // 💰 `return getStateFromArray(arrayOfValues)`
      return state
    }
    case 'MULTILINE': {
      // 🐨 change this to handle the `action.value` from the multiline input.
      // 💰 `return getStateFromArray(arrayOfValues)`
      return state
    }
    case 'MULTISELECT': {
      // 🐨 change this to handle the `action.selectedOptions` from the select.
      // 💰 a <select> DOM node has a `selectedOptions` property which is an
      // array of <option> DOM nodes. Each of those has a `value` property.
      // 💰 you can use `action.selectedOptions.map` to map over those options
      // and get your array of values.
      // 💰 `return getStateFromArray(arrayOfValues)`

  // because React will not be able to update the state of the fields once we
  // add our onChange handlers we'll need to store that state ourselves.
  // 🐨 use the useReducer hook with the fancyFormReducer from above and the
  // initial state for each of the fields:
  //   commaSeparated: '' (for the <input />)
  //   multiline: '' (for the <textarea />)
  //   multiSelect: [] (for the <select />)
  //
  // Now we need to add an onChange event handler for each of the form fields.
  // Each handler will be unique to the type of input we're using, but they
  // will all be pretty simple and just call dispatch with the information the
  // reducer needs to calculate the new state (in my final version I just use
  // inline arrow functions that call dispatch).
